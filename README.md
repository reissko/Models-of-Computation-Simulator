# 🧮 Models of Computation Simulator

A Python-based interactive simulator for exploring **formal models of
computation** --- including **DFAs**, **NFAs**, **PDAs**, and **Turing
Machines** --- through an easy-to-use GUI.

This tool is designed for students and instructors studying **Automata
Theory** and **Formal Languages**.\
It allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **test** computational
models using JSON definitions and visual testing interfaces.

## 🚀 Features

- **Graphical Menu System (Tkinter)**
  - Choose to **Create**, **Test**, or **Quit** the application.
- **Model Creation Interface**
  - Input fields for `model`, `Q`, `sigma`, `delta`, `q0`, and `F`.
  - Built-in scrollable/wrappable help window for formatting the
    `delta` transition function.
- **JSON-Based Model Storage**
  - Models are saved in a consistent JSON schema compatible with all
    automaton types.
- **Simulator Framework**
  - Supports deterministic and nondeterministic automata, with
    planned support for PDAs and TMs.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reissko/Models-of-Computation-Simulator.git
cd Models-of-Computation-Simulator
```

### 2. Set up your environment

This project requires **Python 3.10+** and uses only the standard
library.

To confirm:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 3. Run the simulator

```bash
python gui_main_menu.py
```

## 🧩 JSON Model Format

Each model is stored in a JSON file like the following:

```json
{
  "model": "NFA",
  "Q": ["q0", "q1", "q2"],
  "sigma": ["a", "b"],
  "delta": {
    "q0": { "a": ["q0", "q1"], "b": ["q0"], "epsilon": [] },
    "q1": { "a": ["q2"], "b": [], "epsilon": [] },
    "q2": { "a": [], "b": [], "epsilon": [] }
  },
  "q0": "q0",
  "F": ["q2"]
}
```

### Notes for creating models

- `Q`: list of all states\
- `sigma`: alphabet symbols\
- `delta`: transitions (`state → symbol → next states`)\
- `q0`: start state\
- `F`: accepting states

Relaxed formatting (e.g., `{ q0: { a: [q1] } }`) is allowed; the system
converts it to valid JSON.

## 🪶 GUI Components

### Main Menu

- **TEST a model** --- Placeholder for testing interface
- **CREATE a model** --- Opens the detailed delta-format help window
- **QUIT** --- Exits with confirmation

### Scrollable Help Window

Shows detailed, formatted instructions for how to write the `delta`
field, with scrolling and wrapping.
